# weekcore

Writing a weak CPU in one week (inspired by
[twitchcore](https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore)).

Programs for this CPU will initially be very simple, just manipulating some
numbers and maybe characters. When it starts to work I'll extend it's IO
capabilities enough that _Conway's Game of Life_ can be sanely implemented.
