An ideal cpu can be broken down into 3 parts

1: Memory
2: Control Unit
3: Arithmetic Logic Unit

Each of these 3 parts can be broken down into smaller units: memory can be
broken down into main-memory and registers, the Control Unit can be broken down
into decode-fetch-execute and the ALU can be broken down into arithmetic,
logical and comparison circuits.

Along with each of these components we'll also write an assembler and some test
programs.


Note on RISC-V ISA:
The immediate variants of riscv instructions allow performing an operation
between a register and a constant instead of 2 registers, e.g. `addi x2 x3 -10`
as opposed to a normal `add x2 x3 x4`.


Endiannes refers to the address of the most and least significant bytes of a word.
A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest
memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian
system stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address.


### INSTRUCTION LAYOUTS ###

Instructions are big-endian.
There are 4 types of instructions (bit ranges are inclusive):

S-type
31   29  28    24  23    19  18                                             0
[op   ]  [fn    ]  [r_a   ]  [imm_s                                         ]

R-type
31   29  28    24  23    19  18    14  13     9  8                          0
[op   ]  [fn    ]  [r_a   ]  [r_b    ]  [r_c    ]  [empty                     ]

I-type
31   29  28    24  23    19  18    14  13                                   0
[op   ]  [fn    ]  [r_a   ]  [r_b    ]  [imm_i                               ]

B-type
31   29  28    24  23    19  18    14  13               7  6                0
[op   ]  [fn    ]  [r_a   ]  [r_b    ]  [imm_b1          ]  [imm_b2          ]
